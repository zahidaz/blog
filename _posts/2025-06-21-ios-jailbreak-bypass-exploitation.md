Once a device is jailbroken, many apps immediately detect the altered environment and refuse to run, cutting off access to its services such as banking, streaming, or gaming platforms. To counter this, jailbreak developers create tweaks that employ sophisticated obfuscation techniques. But even the most advanced anti-detection mechanisms can harbor critical logic flaws.

<!--more-->

A tweak is a modification or addition to the iOS operating system or its apps that changes their behavior, appearance, or functionality. These tweaks are typically created by third-party developers and require a jailbroken device for installation, as Apple restricts such deep system modifications on standard iPhones and iPads.

But it isn't just about evading detection; it's a constant cat-and-mouse game between the hackers and the defenders. To stay hidden, these tweaks employ sophisticated obfuscation techniques, dynamically construct sensitive strings, and hook low-level system calls; making reverse engineering a daunting challenge.

For a detailed overview of how iOS jailbreak tweaks are structured and installed, you may want to read [Inside an iOS Jailbreak Tweak: Structure and Installation](/ios/jailbreak/reverse-engineering/2024/06/18/dissecting-ios-tweak-structure.html).

This article takes a deep dive into one such real-world iOS tweak, packaged as `com.icraze.hestia_1.6.2_iphoneos-arm.deb`. It's a prime example of a tweak that:

- Uses dynamic string generation and indirect control flow to evade static analysis
- Hooks critical system calls to block jailbreak evidence from being detected
- And yet harbors a subtle but critical logic flaw that can be exploited to detect the tweak and the jailbreak

Through a combination of static reverse engineering and dynamic runtime instrumentation, I will walk you through how this tweak works under the hood, the anti-analysis techniques it employs, and how these very mechanisms can become its undoing.

## Overview

The tweak is delivered as a Debian package `.deb`, typical in the jailbreaking ecosystem, and targets jailbroken iOS devices. It installs its components into system locations used by MobileSubstrate (now Substitute or similar injectors), a framework that allows tweaks to hook into processes.

One of its mechanisms involves in this tweak is hooking low-level system calls such as `unlink()` to prevent jailbreak-related files from being deleted or detected. Instead of simply blocking the action, the tweak misleads the calling code by making protected paths appear inaccessible or non-existent. This is just one of many obfuscation strategies it uses; the tweak also dynamically constructs strings, hides symbols, and manipulates control flow to frustrate both static and dynamic analysis.

The core files and folders extracted from the `.deb` archive look like this:

```
Library/
├── MobileSubstrate
│   └── DynamicLibraries
│       ├── Hestia.dylib
│       └── Hestia.plist
├── PreferenceBundles
│   └── HestiaPrefs.bundle
│       ├── Alerts.plist
│       ├── HestiaPrefs

│       └── icon@3x.png
└── PreferenceLoader
    └── Preferences
        └── HestiaPrefs.plist
```

The critical binary is `Hestia.dylib`, which is injected into all app processes. The binary is a fat Mach-O supporting both arm64 and arm64e architectures:

```bash
$ file Hestia.dylib
Hestia.dylib: Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library arm64
```

During runtime, this library becomes the core of the tweak's jailbreak detection bypass logic.

You can reverse engineer and analyze the binary using tools such as [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/).

## Anti-Static Analysis Techniques

The tweak uses multiple layers of obfuscation and anti-analysis tricks designed to make static reverse engineering as difficult as possible:

### Runtime String Construction

Instead of embedding sensitive strings like jailbreak paths, scheme names, or app identifiers in plaintext, the tweak builds these strings dynamically at runtime. Functions located at addresses like `0x00037020` compute arrays such as `_disallowedPaths` and others by piecing together string fragments in memory.

This prevents static string scanning tools from easily locating critical detection data, forcing analysts to execute or hook the binary to recover these values.

### Dead Code and Code Caves

The binary includes unreachable instructions and inserted nop (no-operation) instructions to confuse disassemblers and decompilers. For example, a snippet looks like this:

```assembly
0002e7d8 1f 20 03 d5     nop
0002e7dc a8 52 32 58     ldr x8, 0x93230
0002e7e0 00 01 1f d6     br x8
0002e7e4 01              ?? 01
```

Instructions after the branch (`br`) are never executed but remain in the code to disrupt linear control flow analysis. This kind of noise makes automated tools struggle to identify the real logic and jump targets.

### Indirect Branching and Dynamic Control Flow

The tweak avoids direct jump instructions with fixed targets. Instead, it loads branch targets dynamically from pointers or offsets calculated at runtime:

```assembly
ldr x8, [x8, w0, UXTW #0x3]
br x8
```

By calculating the next code address based on register values, it prevents straightforward static control flow graph generation, forcing dynamic tracing or emulation to understand the true behavior.

## Dynamic Analysis to Extract Hidden Data

If you load the file into Ghidra, you will notice the `_disallowedPaths` array located at address `0x97A40` in the arm64 slice. If you examine all the functions referencing this location; specifically take a note of the one function that writes to it.

Static analysis alone isn't enough. To uncover what strings are generated, I employed Frida, a dynamic instrumentation framework, to hook Objective-C methods at runtime.

The function that writes to the `_disallowedPaths` location uses `[NSArray arrayWithObjects:count:]` to generate the array of strings dynamically. By hooking this method, I can capture all the strings passed to it during execution, avoiding the need to reverse engineer the entire function logic.

Here's a snippet of the Frida hook script used:

```javascript
if (ObjC.available) {
    var NSArray = ObjC.classes.NSArray;
    Interceptor.attach(NSArray['+ arrayWithObjects:count:'].implementation, {
        onEnter: function(args) {
            var count = args[3].toInt32();
            if (count < 400) return;  // Only large arrays expected deduced from the context of the function
            
            var ptrArray = args[2];
            for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                var ptrStr = ptr(ptrArray).add(i * Process.pointerSize).readPointer();
                var nsStr = ObjC.Object(ptrStr);
                console.log(nsStr.toString());
            }
        }
    });
}
```

Sample of the extracted paths:

```
/Applications/Cydia.app
/var/jb
/taurine/launchjailbreak
/libblackjack
```

These paths represent locations or files that, if found on the device, are considered telltale signs of jailbreaking. The tweak uses these lists to block or modify behaviors that would expose the jailbreak.

## Intercepting the unlink() System Call

At the external section of the Mach-O file, at address `0x000a0280`, you will find the `_unlink` symbol. This symbol is later referenced by the following instructions:

```assembly
LAB_00008f68 
00008f68 1f 20 03 d5     nop
00008f6c a0 95 27 58     ldr        x0 => _unlink (address 0x000a0280)
00008f70 01 a9 12 10     adr        x1, my_unlink
00008f74 1f 20 03 d5     nop
00008f78 42 4a 47 10     adr        x2, ptr_original_unlink
00008f7c 1f 20 03 d5     nop
00008f80 e5 1b 01 94     bl         _MSHookFunction  ; undefined _MSHookFunction()
00008f84 1f 20 03 d5     nop
00008f88 48 5d 3d 58     ldr        x8, DAT_00083b30 = 0x00008f90
00008f8c 00 01 1f d6     br         x8 => LAB_00008f90
```

The function located at address `0x0002e490`, which I've named `my_unlink`, acts as the hook for the original `_unlink` system call using `_MSHookFunction`. Below is a reverse-engineered approximation of this hooked function, demonstrating how it intercepts and modifies unlink behavior at runtime. Rather than outright preventing deletion of files in disallowed paths, the tweak cleverly hooks the `unlink()` syscall to create the illusion that these file locations are inaccessible. This approach misleads the calling code and helps conceal the presence of a jailbreak on the device.

A decompiled approximation of the hook at `0x2E490` is:

```c
// Manually reverse engineered implementation of the hooked unlink() function
int my_unlink(char *path_to_unlink_raw) {
    int ret;
    undefined8 NSFileManager;
    size_t path_length;
    undefined8 path_to_unlink;
    int *error;

    // Obtain the default NSFileManager instance
    _objc_msgSend(0x583495a8d503201f, &_OBJC_CLASS_$_NSFileManager, "defaultManager");
    NSFileManager = _objc_retainAutoreleasedReturnValue();

    // Convert raw C string to NSString using its file system representation
    path_length = _strlen(path_to_unlink_raw);
    path_to_unlink = _objc_msgSend(
        NSFileManager,
        "stringWithFileSystemRepresentation:length:",
        path_to_unlink_raw,
        path_length
    );
    path_to_unlink = _objc_retain(path_to_unlink);

    // Release the file manager instance as it's no longer needed
    _objc_release(NSFileManager);

    // --> Check if the path is in the disallowedPaths array
    contains(path_to_unlink, _disallowedPaths);

    // NOTE: Decompilation was incomplete, but the logic implies:
    // If the path is disallowed, simulate an error to block the operation.
    error = ___error();
    *error = 2;  // Typically indicates "No such file or directory" (ENOENT)

    // Clean up
    _objc_release(path_to_unlink);

    // --> Forward the call to the original unlink function otherwise
    ret = (*ptr_original_unlink)(path_to_unlink_raw);
    return ret;
}
```

This hook intercepts calls to the standard `unlink()` system function. Instead of simply allowing or denying file deletion, it first converts the file path into an NSString and checks whether it matches any entries in the `_disallowedPaths` array. If the path is flagged, it simulates an error by modifying the errno value; causing the unlink to fail without actually attempting to delete the file. Otherwise, it silently forwards the call to the original `unlink()` implementation.

## Critical Logic Flaw: How the Tweak Exposes Itself

The flaw lies in the substring matching approach to detect disallowed paths. The check is naïve: if the file path contains any part of a disallowed path string, the unlink operation is blocked otherwise it goes through.

This introduces two exploitable weaknesses:

1. **False positives**: the tweak may deny unlinking legitimate files if their names happen to include substrings matching the disallowed paths.
2. **Detectable behavior**: Apps can attempt to unlink carefully crafted filenames that contain these substrings. If the operation fails ; despite the file being located in a place where deletion would normally succeed on a non-jailbroken device ; it confirms the presence of the tweak.

## Proof of Concept: Detecting the Tweak via unlink() Behavior

Using Frida, we can call the real `unlink()` syscall with two test paths:

```javascript
// Make sure Hestia is enabled for your app under Settings → Hestia → Enabled Application

const NSHomeDirectory = new NativeFunction(
    Module.findExportByName(null, 'NSHomeDirectory'),
    'pointer',
    []
);

const homeDir = new ObjC.Object(NSHomeDirectory()).toString();
const unlink = new NativeFunction(Module.findExportByName(null, 'unlink'), 'int', ['pointer']);

function testUnlink(fileName) {
    const filePath = `${homeDir}/Documents/${fileName}`;
    
    // Write dummy content to the file
    const file = new File(filePath, 'w');
    file.write('12345');
    file.close();
    
    // Attempt to unlink the file
    const filePtr = Memory.allocUtf8String(filePath);
    const result = unlink(filePtr);
    console.log(`unlink result for ${fileName}:`, result);
}

// File expected to fail due to jailbreak substring match
testUnlink('checkra1n');

// File expected to succeed normally
testUnlink('index.js');
```

The tweak's hook blocks unlinking for the first path because it contains the substring `checkra1n`, revealing the tweak's active presence.

## Conclusion

This exploration shows how even a well-obfuscated tweak, loaded with anti-analysis tricks and runtime hiding mechanisms, can be dissected with careful static and dynamic analysis.

More importantly, it reveals that stealth techniques relying on heuristic substring matching can introduce exploitable logic flaws. These flaws undermine the very purpose of the tweak by allowing detection through behavioral side channels.

The lesson for both attackers and defenders is clear: sophisticated obfuscation doesn't guarantee security. Sometimes, the most complex systems fail due to simple logical oversights. In the endless game of cat and mouse between security researchers and evasion developers, understanding these fundamental principles often matters more than the complexity of the tools involved.
